  <h3>Problem:</h3>
  <br>
  <div>
  We humans can get confused by many visual aspects. Whether that's due to image tricks
  or just simple image similarities. In our project, we experiment this phenomenon with 
  Computer Vision techniques to see how computers can react to this slight differences.

        The following meme shows the confusion we try to create in our Computer Vision model:

    <h3>Data:</h3>

    <div>
        We chose the following <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification">Kaggle Dataset</a>.
        This dataset includes 6,000 scraped images from Google Image without duplicates.
        80% of our data is used to train our model and 20% of the data is used for testing.

    Here are some sample pictures of our dataset:
